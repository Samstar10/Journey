//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
let arrMovies = ['F & F', 'HIMYM', 'Friends'];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
let firstMovie = arrMovies[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
let arrLength = arrMovies.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
let lastMovie = arrMovies[arrMovies.length - 1];
